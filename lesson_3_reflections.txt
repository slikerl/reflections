When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping 
all your work local?

When you are using a computer other than the one whereyour project 
is locally stored


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you want to have multiple computers, and only change the local 
repository one at a time, then manually pulling changes rather than 
automatic updates from the remote repository would be necessary.


Descripe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When
would you use one instead of another?

forks are copies of one GitHub repository onto another GitHub 
repository. Clones are copies of repositories on GitHub and 
a local machine or between two repostories on a local machine. A 
branch is a new lineage of commits within a repository. You
would use a fork if you want to copy an existing repository that 
is available on GitHub in order to make your own changes to it (if 
you don't have permission to edit the original). You would use a 
Clone to copy a reposity from GitHub onto your local machine or 
to duplicate a repository with your machine. You would use a 
branch within a repository when introducing an experimental feature 
without disrupting the master.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the 
remote stored locally?

You can work on it offline
