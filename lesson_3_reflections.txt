When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are using a computer other than the one whereyour project is locally stored


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you want to have multiple computers, and only change the local 
repository one at a time, then manually pulling changes rather than 
automatic updates from the remote repository would be necessary.
